<body>
<p>My name is Jacob Lott. I am currently 20 years
old, and I live in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am
currently doing the Fullstack bootcamp at the Deep Dive
Coding Bootcamp. </p>

<p>I graduated from Rio Grande High School in 2018. After I graduated, I worked a
summer job at Cliff's Amusement Park in the summer. I didn't really like it because
it was to hot outside. But then the job I took after that was being a Cart Attendant at Sam's Club.
I worked there for a whole year, and also went to CNM for college. after a year, I dropped out of CNM
because I had to take classes I didn't like just to get a Degree in Computer Science. I also quit my job
at Sam's Club because I was tired of doing that king of labor in the heat of the summer
and the ice cold winter. That's around the time I found out about the Deep Dive Coding
Bootcamp. I decided to give it a try, and see if I can get a career out of it. Plus,
after years of experience, I like coding, so I'm really going to like this program, and hopefully
my life after it as well.</p>
